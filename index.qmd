# Hello!
My name is Olivia Vruwink (pronounced 'vroo-wink'). After working clinically as a speech-language pathologist in the public schools for three years, I enrolled in a doctoral program in Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences at the University of Minnesota. I am studying various aspects of rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury, under the supervision of [Dr. Natalie Covington](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/nvcoving). Please click the 'About Me' tab at the top to learn more!

Welcome to my personal website, which is still very much under construction. Many thanks to Samantha Csik for her spectacular [tutorial on creating a personal website using Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/).
